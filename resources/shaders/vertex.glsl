// this is an example of what is probably the most simple vertex shader possible.
// We simply take in a 3D vector and pass it along as output without doing any processing / transformation.

// Each shader begins with a declaration of the shader version
#version 330 core

// Here we declare the input vertex attributes
// In this case, we just need a single 3D vector because we just want position information for each vector
// We also explicitly state that this input should be at location 0

    // It is mandatory to set this (as it is the output!).
